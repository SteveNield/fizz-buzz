# Fizz Buzz Test

Fizz Buzz is a children's game: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz

In the solution you will find a test project and a console application project.  

Create a new branch to store your commits using the below command:

`git checkout -b testanswers`

It is good practice to commit and push often.

The first part of the challenge is to make the unit tests in the test project pass (without modifying the tests).  This means you will have to complete the implementation of the IFizzBuzzer interface (FizzBuzzer.cs) which has only been developed enough to allow the solution to compile.

The second part of the challenge is to add any two additional unit tests which you feel may be required.  These tests should answer the question: is it possible to cause the system under test to behave unexpectedly?

When you're done, create a pull request for your branch and send me a skype to let me know.
